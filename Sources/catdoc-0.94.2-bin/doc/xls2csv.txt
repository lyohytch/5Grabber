1mDESCRIPTION0m
       1mxls2csv 22mreads MS-Excel spreadsheet and dumps its content as comma-sepa-
       rated values to stdout. Numbers are printed without delimiters, strings
       are enclosed in the double quotes. Double-quotes inside string are dou-
       bled.

1mOPTIONS0m
       1m-x      22mprint unknown Unicode chars as \xNNNN, rather than as  question
               marks

       1m-c4m22mchar24m  cell separator char. By default - comma.

       1m-b4m22mstring0m
               sheet  break  string. This string (by default - formfeed) would
               be output at the end of each  workbook  page.  This  string  is
               printed  after  page starting at start of line, but no linefeed
               would be automatically added at the end of string. Include new-
               line  at the ent of sheet separator if you want it to appear on
               separate line by itself

       1m-g4m22mnumber24m number of decimal digits in the numbers.  By  default  maximal
                double precision (system-dependent macro DBL_DIG) is used.

       1m-q4m22mnumber0m
               set  quote mode. In quote mode 0 cell contents is never quoted.
               In quote mode 1  only  strings  which  contain  spaces,  double
               quotes  or  commas  are  quoted.  In quote mode 2 (default) all
               cells with type string are quoted.  In quote mode 3  all  cells
               are quoted.


       1m-d4m22mcharset`0m
               -  specifies  destination charset name. Charset file has format
               described in CHARACTER SETS section of 1mcatdoc22m(1)  manual  page.
               By  default,  current  locale charset would be used if langinfo
               support was enabled at the compile time.


       1m-s4m22mcharset0m
               - specifies source charset. Typically, Excel  files  have  CODE
               PAGE  record,  which denotes input charset, but for some reason
               you may wish to override it.

       1m-f4m22mformat0m
               - specifies date/time format to use for  output  of  all  Excel
               date  and  time  values.  If this option is not specified, for-
               mat, specified in the spreadsheet is used. On POSIX system  any
               format,  allowed  by  1mstrftime22m(3)  can be used as value of this
               option. Under MS-DOS 1mxls2csv 22mimplements limited set of 1mstrftime0m
               formats, namely 1mm22m, 1md22m, 1my22m, 1mY22m, 1mb22m, 1ml22m, 1mp22m, 1mH22m, 1mM22m, 1mS22m.
